# JSON Diff

Offline browser extension for [https://jsondiff.com/](https://jsondiff.com/)

## Motivation

I regularly use [https://jsondiff.com/](https://jsondiff.com/) for comparing JSON documents however it is a website and I have to have internet connectivity always to use it.

So I decided to build a web extension which works offline and easily accessible on a button click.

## Advantages of extension

1. Since this is a offline extension, you download once and run on your laptop whether you are connected to internet or not.
2. Sometimes, the JSON documents we compare may include sensitive information, and it's very important to review the privacy policies and data handling practices of any website before uploading them. However, with the offline extension `JSON Diff`, you can use it without concerns about privacy policies and data handling, as it operates offline.

> **Your data stays in your browser and never leaves your system**.
